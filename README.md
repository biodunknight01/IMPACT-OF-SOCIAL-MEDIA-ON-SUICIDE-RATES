# IMPACT-OF-SOCIAL-MEDIA-ON-SUICIDE-RATES
This dashboard analyzes the relationship between social media usage and suicide rates from 2010 to 2019. It tracks trends in suicide rates alongside the growth of Twitter and Facebook users, highlighting gender-based patterns. The data explores potential correlations between social media engagement

Observations: 
1. Suicide Rate Trends (2010–2019)
Overall Decline: The suicide rate, expressed as a percentage change since 2010, shows a steady decline from 300% in 2010 to approximately 261.35% in 2019. This suggests a reduction in the total suicide rate over the years.
Yearly Pattern: The decline is gradual, with significant drops in 2015–2017, where the percentage fell from 286.61% to 267.05%.
Key Observation: By 2019, the maximum suicide rate change value reaches 100%, highlighting a benchmark in the data’s measurement scale.
2. Social Media User Trends
Twitter Usage (2010–2019)
Consistent Growth: Twitter user counts show a significant increase, reaching a change value of 1889% in 2019, up from 1600% in 2014. The trend appears linear, suggesting continuous user adoption.
Large Gain: Total Twitter usage increase since 2010 is recorded as 13.88K%.
Facebook Usage (2010–2019)
Steady Increase Until 2016: Facebook users peaked in growth percentage around 2016 at 785%. However, the rate started to plateau and decline slightly in subsequent years.
Moderate Rise: The cumulative increase in Facebook user counts since 2010 is marked at 7.66K%, which is notably lower than Twitter’s growth.
3. Gender-based Observations
Suicide Rates by Gender
Similar Decline Across Genders: Both males and females show consistent percentage declines in suicide rates from 2010 (100%) to 2019 (approximately 88%).
Smaller Gender Gap: There is little variation in the decline percentages across sexes, suggesting suicide trends are not significantly gender-skewed.
Twitter Usage by Gender
Uniform Growth: Male (MLE), Female (FMLE), and BTSX (likely representing a non-binary or other gender category) all exhibit an equal increase of 4.63% in Twitter usage over the observed timeline.
. Cross-comparison Insights
Inverse Relationship: There appears to be an inverse relationship between the increasing adoption of social media (Twitter and Facebook) and the declining suicide rates. While this suggests a potential link, it does not establish causality.
Platform Comparison: Twitter growth is significantly outpacing Facebook in terms of user adoption percentages, indicating a shift in user preferences or greater platform expansion.
5. Key Metrics Summary
Maximum Suicide Rate Change Since 2010: 100%.
Cumulative Increase in Social Media Usage:
Twitter: 13.88K%.
Facebook: 7.66K%.

Recommendations:
1. Strengthening Mental Health Support Systems
Expand Online Support Networks:
Leverage the increasing use of social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to create and promote digital mental health support systems. These could include:
Virtual counselling sessions.
Chatbots designed for mental health support.
Peer-support groups accessible through social media.
Crisis Helpline Visibility on Social Media:
Partner with social media platforms to ensure suicide prevention helplines are prominently displayed, especially in response to concerning content or search terms.
2. Encouraging Healthy Social Media Habits
Promote Positive Engagement:
Encourage users to share uplifting content, personal success stories, or acts of kindness to foster a sense of community and positivity.
Combat Cyberbullying:
Implement stricter moderation and AI-based detection tools to reduce cyberbullying incidents, which are known to negatively impact mental health.
Screen Time Awareness Campaigns:
Educate users about balancing online activities with offline social interactions, reducing excessive screen time that could contribute to mental health issues.
3. Gender-Specific Interventions
Tailored Mental Health Campaigns:
Recognizing that suicide rates have a similar declining trend across genders, interventions should address specific stressors affecting each gender. For example:
Address societal pressures for men (e.g., stigma around seeking help).
Focus on emotional well-being programs for women (e.g., stress from multitasking roles).
Inclusive Support for Non-Binary Individuals (BTSX):
Offer inclusive support systems that address the unique mental health challenges faced by non-binary individuals, who may face higher levels of discrimination or isolation

4. Utilizing Social Media as a Research Tool
Monitor Trends in Real-Time:
Use social media data to track public sentiment and identify patterns or spikes in mental health issues. This can help deploy timely interventions.
Early Warning Systems:
Train algorithms to identify and flag potentially suicidal behaviour or distress signals in posts or messages, enabling proactive support.
Awareness Campaigns:
Collaborate with influencers and content creators to spread awareness about mental health resources and de-stigmatize seeking help.
5. Educational and Preventive Measures
Mental Health Education in Schools:
Incorporate modules on emotional intelligence, digital literacy, and cyber-resilience to prepare young users for the challenges of navigating social media.
Parental Guidance and Monitoring:
Educate parents on how to monitor and guide their children's social media use while encouraging open communication about mental health.
Community Workshops:
Organize workshops to train individuals in recognizing signs of depression, anxiety, and suicidal tendencies in their peers or family members.
6. Collaborative Efforts with Social Media Companies
Platform-Specific Interventions:
Partner with platforms to:
Reduce harmful content exposure.
Prioritize mental health campaigns in algorithms.
Provide suicide prevention training to moderators.
Ethical Algorithm Design:
Advocate for algorithms that reduce harmful comparisons, sensationalized content, and echo chambers that can exacerbate mental health challenges
7. Research and Policy Development
Deepen Research:
Conduct longitudinal studies to establish causal relationships between social media usage and suicide rates. Focus on:
How specific activities (e.g., passive scrolling vs. active engagement) impact mental health.
Age-based susceptibility to harmful social media use.
Policy Advocacy:
Work with policymakers to implement regulations ensuring:
Ethical social media use.
Mandatory mental health disclaimers for harmful content.
Transparent data sharing for academic research on mental health.
8. Regional and Global Partnerships
Local Interventions:
Tailor mental health programs to the cultural and societal contexts of specific regions to ensure relevance and effectiveness.
Global Initiatives:
Join global campaigns to standardize mental health practices on social media platforms, ensuring consistent protection for all users.
9. Evaluation and Feedback Mechanism
Measure Impact:
Regularly assess the effectiveness of implemented strategies by monitoring suicide rates, social media usage patterns, and mental health surveys.
Iterative Improvements:
Use feedback loops to refine interventions and ensure they remain relevant to evolving social media trends and user needs.
By combining preventive education, social media partnerships, and inclusive mental health support, it is possible to address the complex interplay between suicide rates and the growing influence of social media. A multi-stakeholder approach involving governments, tech companies, mental health professionals, and community members is essential to create a safer digital space and reduce suicide rates globally.
